# Dragon12 Board 
## MC9S12DP256 controller

Here you can find design/simulations of different 
projects using a Dragon 12 board.

## University of Costa Rica
#### January, 2021

## Dependencies
Need to install the simulator and some driver, inside "dependencies" folder is explained how to install.

## Projects:

### 1. ep_AppDev [Assembly]
This work analyzes what are embedded processors, 
ISA Architecture, internal processor design, 
application development, ISA 9S12 Model, etc.

### 2. math_ISA_9S12 [Assembly]
This folder contains three different algorith to understand 
program design and development tools and 9S12 ISA model (math operations).

### 3. sqrt_program [Assembly]
This folder contains a sqrt calculator to understand 
modular programming structures, specifically subroutines.

### 4. mtx_KeyBoard [Assembly]
Contains 9S12 Peripherals: Input / Output structures: parallel ports,
clock and Exceptions system, the timer module. 

### 5. mux_Screens [Assembly]
This project works with the Input Capture: pulse accumulator,
screen management (multiplexed screens, self-contained screens)
and the Analog Digital Conversion Module: A / D converters operation,
types of A / D converters, 9S12 A / D converters, ATD records, A / D 
conversion example, ATD external trigger, and ATD port as digital inputs. 

### 6. asyn_commun [Assembly]
This work encompasses the Asynchronous Serial communication application. 
SCI Interface: concepts of serial communication, the Serial Communication Interface 
(SCI), configuration of the SCI Interface and operation of the SCI Interface.
